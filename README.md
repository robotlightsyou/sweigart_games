# sweigart_games

This is practice for me to read and type more code, and generally get it 
into my muscle memory. It was recommended by Al Sweigart(author of this
code) for beginners to manually reenter all this code making modifications
and trying things along the way.

Perhaps I'll add some of my own games, maybe I'll just edit these.
Regardless, it's all just practice.
